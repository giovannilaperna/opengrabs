Disputed grabs are reviewed and resolved by Opengrabs support staff.

Opengrabs does not become a guarantor of any party's performance of a grab. Therefore, although Opengrabs helps in resolving disputes, you assume the risk that any party with whom you trade ( “counterparty”) fails to perform in accordance with your agreement with the counterparty. By using Opengrabs Services, you release Opengrabs from any liability arising out of or related to a counterparty's failure to perform as agreed.

<h6 class="title is-6">Dispute resolution</h6>A disputed trade is most commonly resolved by Opengrabs support moving the escrowed bitcoin to the buyer or the traveler of the disputed grab once the dispute resolution criteria are met.

In rare situations where neither party fulfills the criteria, or it is in other ways unclear or not possible to determine which party has fulfilled the dispute resolution criteria, Opengrabs may decide to resolve the dispute by splitting the escrowed funds between the buyer and the seller evenly or unevenly.

<h6 class="title is-6">Dispute resolution criteria</h6>If the product has not been purchased by the traveler, the dispute will be resolved to the buyer (funds returned to the buyer).

If the product has been purchased and can be returned without cost for the traveler, the dispute will be resolved to the buyer (funds returned to the buyer) once the traveler has been fullt refunded for his payment.

If the product can be returned with additional cost for the traveler, the traveler will be refunded for the cost incurred and the remaining funds will be returned to the buyer (funds split).

If the product can be returned, the dispute will be resolved to the traveler once he has delivered the product to the destination city (funds granted to the traveler).

If the buyer refuses to pick up the product for 7 days since the traveler has arrived to the destination city or before the traveler departure, the dispute will be resolved to the traveler (funds granted to the traveler).

If the buyer and the traveler can reach an agreement about the meeting place, a place choosen by the traveler within the dsetination city will be consider as the meeting place.
